## JavaScript Crawlee & CheerioCrawler template

This template example was built with [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/) to scrape data from a website using [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/) wrapped into [CheerioCrawler](https://crawlee.dev/api/cheerio-crawler/class/CheerioCrawler).

## Included features

- **[Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js)** - toolkit for building [Actors](https://apify.com/actors)
- **[Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/)** - web scraping and browser automation library
- **[Input schema](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/input-schema)** - define and easily validate a schema for your Actor's input
- **[Dataset](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/docs/concepts/storages#working-with-datasets)** - store structured data where each object stored has the same attributes
- **[Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/)** - a fast, flexible & elegant library for parsing and manipulating HTML and XML

## How it works

This code is a JavaScript script that uses Cheerio to scrape data from a website. It then stores the website titles in a dataset.

- The crawler starts with URLs provided from the input `startUrls` field defined by the input schema. Number of scraped pages is limited by `maxPagesPerCrawl` field from the input schema.
- The crawler uses `requestHandler` for each URL to extract the data from the page with the Cheerio library and to save the title and URL of each page to the dataset. It also logs out each result that is being saved.

## Getting started

For complete information [see this article](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development#build-actor-at-apify-console). In short, you will:

1. Build the Actor
2. Run the Actor

## Pull the Actor for local development

If you would like to develop locally, you can pull the existing Actor from Apify console using Apify CLI:

1. Install `apify-cli`

    **Using Homebrew**

    ```bash
    brew install apify-cli
    ```

    **Using NPM**

    ```bash
    npm -g install apify-cli
    ```

2. Pull the Actor by its unique `<ActorId>`, which is one of the following:
    - unique name of the Actor to pull (e.g. "apify/hello-world")
    - or ID of the Actor to pull (e.g. "E2jjCZBezvAZnX8Rb")

    You can find both by clicking on the Actor title at the top of the page, which will open a modal containing both Actor unique name and Actor ID.

    This command will copy the Actor into the current directory on your local machine.

    ```bash
    apify pull <ActorId>
    ```
